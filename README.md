## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Flask**
* **Flask-RESTful**
* **Flask-SQLAlchemy**
* **Flask-Migrate / Alembic**
* **PostgreSQL** (production database on Render; SQLite may be used locally)

---

## ⚙️ Local Setup (Optional)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:P-RF/python-p4-deploying-a-flask-api-to-render.git
cd python-p4-deploying-a-flask-api-to-render
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Using Pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Configuration (Local Development)

### 1. Set your database URI

Export a `DATABASE_URI` environment variable:

```bash
export DATABASE_URI=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>
```

For quick local testing, you may also use SQLite:

```bash
export DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///app.db
```

(PostgreSQL is used in production on Render.)

### 2. Run migrations

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

---

## 🌱 Seeding Sample Data (Optional)

Populate the database with sample bird data:

```bash
python seed.py
```

This will create the following birds:

* Black-Capped Chickadee
* Grackle
* Common Starling
* Mourning Dove

---

## 🚀 Running the Server

This project is deployed on **Render** for production, but you can run it locally in multiple ways depending on what you’re doing.

### 1️⃣ The Development Way (Recommended)

If you’re actively making changes, use Flask’s built-in development server. It includes the debugger and automatically reloads when you save files.

```bash
pipenv shell
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555  # Optional, choose any port you like
flask run
```

The API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5555
```

---

### 2️⃣ The Gunicorn Way (To Mimic Render)

To run the app locally the same way Render runs it (production-style server), use Gunicorn:

```bash
pipenv run gunicorn app:app
```

This is useful for catching deployment-related issues before pushing changes.

**Note:** If you did not add a SQLite fallback in your configuration, you may need to set the database URI manually:

```bash
export DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///app.db
```

---

### 3️⃣ The “Everything Is Broken” Way

If you open VS Code and nothing seems to work (commands not found, Flask won’t run, imports failing), these commands usually fix it:

```bash
pipenv install   # Rebuilds the virtual environment if it’s missing
pipenv shell     # Activates the environment so Flask & SQLAlchemy work
```

Once things are running again, use one of the methods above to start the server.

### Deploying a Flask API to Render
#### Learning Goals
* Set up your local environment for deploying with Render.
* Deploy a basic Flask application to Render.
#### Key Vocab
* Deployment: the processes that make an application available for its intended use. For web applications, this means moving the application to a platform that supports requests from the internet.
* Developer Operations (DevOps): the practices and tools that improve a team's ability to develop and deploy applications quickly.
* PostgreSQL: an open-source relational database system that provides more SQL functionality than SQLite. Unlike SQLite, its data is stored on a server rather than in files.
* Platform as a Service (PaaS): a development and deployment platform that exists on a wide range of servers with different functionality. PaaS solutions reduce maintenance time for a software development team, but can increase cost. Some PaaS solutions, such as Render, provide free tiers for small applications.
### Introduction
In this lesson, we'll be deploying a basic, standalone Flask API application to Render. We'll give instructions to generate the application from scratch and talk through the steps to get the code running on a Render server.

In coming lessons, we'll learn how to add more complexity to the application with a React frontend. Since the setup for a Flask-React application is a bit trickier, it'll be beneficial to see the setup for Flask alone first. Let's get started!

### Environment Setup
To make sure you're able to deploy your application, you'll need to do the following:

Sign Up for a Render Account
You can sign up at for a free account at https://dashboard.render.com/
This is an external link.. We recommend signing up using your GitHub account- this will streamline the process of connecting your applications to Render later on. The instructions below assume you've done that.

Once you've completed the signup process, you will be taken to the Render dashboard.

In order to connect Render to your GitHub account, you'll need to click the "New Web Service" button in the "Web Services" box.

You'll then click the "Build and deploy from a Git repository" button.

select build and deploy from git repo

On the next page, you will see a GitHub heading on the right side and below that a link labeled "Configure account". (If you didn't sign up using GitHub, it will say "Connect account" instead.)

Connect GitHub

Click that link; a modal will appear asking you for permission to install Render on your GitHub account:

Install Render

Click "Install." You should then be taken back to the "Create a New Web Service" page, which should now show a list of your GitHub repos. We won't create a web service just yet so you are free to navigate back to the Render dashboard
This is an external link..

### Install PostgreSQL
Render requires that you use PostgreSQL for your database instead of SQLite. PostgreSQL (or just Postgres for short) is an advanced database management system with more features than SQLite. If you don't already have it installed, you'll need to set it up.

PostgreSQL Installation for WSL
To install Postgres for WSL, run the following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:

``` bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
```
Then confirm that Postgres was installed successfully:

``` bash
$ psql --version
```
Run this command to start the Postgres service:

``` bash
$ sudo service postgresql start
```

Finally, you'll also need to create a database user so that you are able to connect to the database from Flask. First, check what your operating system username is:

``` bash
$ whoami
```

If your username is "ian", for example, you'd need to create a Postgres user with that same name. To do so, run this command to open the Postgres CLI:

``` bash
$ sudo -u postgres -i
```

From the Postgres CLI, run this command (replacing "ian" with your username):
``` bash
$ createuser -sr ian
```
Then enter `control + d` or type `logout` to exit.

This guide
This is an external link. has more info on setting up Postgres on WSL if you get stuck.

### Postgresql Installation for OSX
To install Postgres for OSX, you can use Homebrew:
``` bash
$ brew install postgresql
```
Once Postgres has been installed, run this command to start the Postgres service:
``` bash
$ brew services start postgresql
```
Check your Postgres version:
``` bash
$ psql --version
```

### Create the Database on Render
One limitation of Render is that it only allows one PostgreSQL instance to be created per user account. With this instance, we can create an app, give it some seed data, and deploy it, storing the data in the PostgreSQL instance's database. But then what happens if you want to deploy additional apps to Render? You can probably see how using a single database for multiple apps could get complicated very quickly and potentially cause problems. Fortunately, Render allows users to create multiple databases within a single PostgreSQL instance
This is an external link. so you can have a separate database for each app you deploy.

Let's start by creating the PostgreSQL instance, then we'll create the bird database.

You need to check which version of Postgresql you have on your local machine. Run `psql --version` in your terminal. The output should look something like this, but with your version instead:
``` bash
$ psql --version
psql (PostgreSQL) 15.x
```
Go to the Render dashboard
This is an external link., click the "New +" button and select "PostgreSQL". Enter a name for your database. This can be whatever you like — we're using `my_database`.

Creating a new database

##### Note: Hyphens may not be used in the database names; you should use underscores instead (e.g., my_db, not my-db).

Select the Postgresql version you have from the dropdown.

Render will randomly generate identifiers for the "Database" and "User" fields, or you can create those yourself if you prefer.

For "Region", you can either select the location closest to you or you can use the default selection. Make sure you use the same region when you are creating the web service later in this lesson.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Create Database". It may take a few minutes to create the database. Leave the database page open — you'll need to copy information from it as we proceed.

Next, let's create a database specifically for our bird app. We'll do this using the PostgreSQL interactive terminal, psql
This is an external link..

The command to launch the interactive terminal is provided in the Render database page. Scroll down to the "Connections" section and copy the PSQL command.

psql command link from render page

Paste it into your terminal window and press enter. This command connects you to the remote database. You should now see the `psql` command prompt, `my_database=>` (there may be some numbers appended to the database name).
``` bash
Type "help" for help.

my_database=>
```
If you type the `\l` command to list the databases, you'll see a table that includes `my_database`.
``` bash
Type "help" for help.

my_database=> \l
```
You will need to hit the enter key to exit the database listing and return to the PSQL prompt.

To create the database for our bird app, we'll run the `CREATE DATABASE` SQL command. Again, you can name your database whatever you like; we're using `bird_app_db`. Be sure to include the semi-colon at the end of the command:
``` bash
my_database=> CREATE DATABASE bird_app_db;
```
Now if you run the `\l` command again, you should see that `bird_app_db` has been added to the list of databases.

You can now exit `psql` using the `\q` command.

##### Note: The Render dashboard will not show the information about the `bird_app_db` database; it will only show the name you assigned when you created the PostgreSQL instance on Render (`my_database`). To see any other databases you have on your PostgreSQL instance, you'll need to use `psql`. For now, be sure to make a note of your new database's name as we'll need to use it in the next step.

### Creating a Flask App to Deploy
We'll be following the steps in Render's "Deploy a Flask App"
This is an external link. guide, so if you get stuck and are looking for more assistance, check that guide.

The first thing we'll need to do is create our new Flask application. Make sure you're in a non-lab directory, then run:
``` bash
$ mkdir bird-app && cd $_
$ pipenv install Flask gunicorn psycopg2-binary Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate SQLAlchemy-Serializer Flask-RESTful
```
**NOTE: You may want to specify versions for these packages when you work on your Phase 4 and Phase 5 projects. This will prevent updates to these modules from breaking your code. You can check all versions with the command `pipenv requirements`.

This will set create an application directory and install some valuable libraries for building a RESTful API. Let's also run the following command to generate a `requirements.txt` file:
``` bash
$ pipenv requirements > requirements.txt
```
`requirements.txt` is very similar to a Pipfile- the primary difference here is that instead of supporting a local virtual environment through pipenv, it supports the creation of an application environment on a PaaS platform. (There are some different tools that use this file as well.)

### Assigning DATABASE_URI
To test our Flask app locally, we need to assign the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable to reference the bird database we created on Render. Return to the Render dashboard
This is an external link. and click on the "my_database" link (or whatever you named the Postgresql instance). Scroll down to `Connections` and copy the "External Database URL".

external database url

You will assign this string to the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable, but you need to make two modifications to the external database URL string:

modifying database uri

Modify the protocol at the beginning of the string to say `postgresql` instead of `postgres`.
Modify the database name at the end of the string to say `bird_app_db` instead of `my_database`.
Do not modify any other part of the string. Assign the environment variable by typing the following in a terminal:
``` bash
$ export DATABASE_URI=<Modified External Database URL goes here>
```

### Building the Demo App
Let's set up our app, models, and migrations to get things started. You can create the files directly within the `bird-app` folder since we won't be needing a `server` sub-folder.

``` bash
# app.py

import os

from flask import Flask, jsonify, make_response
from flask_migrate import Migrate
from flask_restful import Api, Resource

from models import db, Bird

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URI')
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.json.compact = False

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

api = Api(app)

class Birds(Resource):

    def get(self):
        birds = [bird.to_dict() for bird in Bird.query.all()]
        return make_response(jsonify(birds), 200)

api.add_resource(Birds, '/birds')
```
``` bash
# models.py

from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy_serializer import SerializerMixin

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Bird(db.Model, SerializerMixin):
    __tablename__ = 'birds'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String)
    species = db.Column(db.String)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Bird {self.name} | Species: {self.species}>'
```

Add this data to the `seed.py` file:
``` bash
# seed.py

from app import app
from models import db, Bird

with app.app_context():


    print('Deleting existing birds...')
    Bird.query.delete()

    print('Creating bird objects...')
    chickadee = Bird(name='Black-Capped Chickadee', species='Poecile Atricapillus')
    grackle = Bird(name='Grackle', species='Quiscalus Quiscula')
    starling = Bird(name='Common Starling', species='Sturnus Vulgaris')
    dove = Bird(name='Mourning Dove', species='Zenaida Macroura')

    print('Adding bird objects to transaction...')
    db.session.add_all([chickadee, grackle, starling, dove])

    print('Committing transaction...')
    db.session.commit()

    print('Complete.')
```

Then run these commands to generate the database and run the migrations and seed file:

``` bash 
$ flask db init
# => ...
$ flask db revision --autogenerate -m'create table birds'
# => ...
$ flask db upgrade
# => ...
$ python seed.py
# => Deleting existing birds...
# => Creating bird objects...
# => Adding bird objects to transaction...
# => Committing transaction...
# => Complete.
```

`flask db upgrade` creates a new PostgreSQL database to be associated with your application based on the configuration on Render and in `models.py`. Unlike with SQLite, the actual database file isn't created in the application's folder; it lives on Render's servers and will not show up in your directory structure at all.

To make sure the app works locally before deploying, run `gunicorn app:app`.

``` bash
$ gunicorn app:app
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/birds and confirm the app displays the bird data:

screenprint of birds app on localhost

##### NOTE: gunicorn runs on port 8000 by default. Because this does not conflict with any system ports on MacOS, Windows, or Linux, we won't change it here.

### Deploying
Now that we've got some working code, it's time to get that code to run on a Render server! The process of uploading our code to Render is managed by Git. This makes it easy to deploy new versions using a tool most developers, including yourself, are already familiar with.

Make a commit to save your changes, then push them to a remote repo:
``` bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```
Next, you'll need to create a repository in GitHub:

github create repo form. repo is set to public

...and push your work to the new repo:

``` bash
$ git remote add <remote_name> <remote_repo_url>
$ git push -u <remote_name> <local_branch_name>
```

### Configuring the Environment and Deploying
Head back to the Render dashboard and click "New+" to make a new Web Service. If you connected to GitHub when you signed up, you should see a list of all your repos! Find your bird API and click "Connect".

Give your application a name. Render should be able to figure out the github repo is for a Flask application and will fill in the Runtime, Build Command, and Start Command. If not, configure the application as seen below. Try to specify the same region as the database instance.

configuration screen for a web service in render. the root directory is left
blank. environment is Python 3. Region is Oregon (US West). Branch is main. Build
command is "pip install -r requirements.txt". start command is "gunicorn
app:app"

Before our first successful deployment, we need to click on the "Advanced" button, then add two environment variables:

`PYTHON_VERSION` is `3.8.13`.

`DATABASE_URI` is the Internal Database URL from your PostgreSQL database (not External Database URL). Don't forget to change the protocol to postgresql and the database name to bird_app_db! It should look something like this:
``` bash
postgresql://my_database_user:#################################################/bird_app_db
```
change render environment variables

##### NOTE: If your database instance and web service are in different regions, you may need to use the External Database URL for the connection.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the "Create Web Service" button. It may take a few minutes to build and deploy your application.

Your URL is located under your app name at the top of the screen.

Click on the link, navigate to `/birds`, and view your work in all its glory!

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Black-Capped Chickadee",
    "species": "Poecile Atricapillus"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Grackle",
    "species": "Quiscalus Quiscula"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Common Starling",
    "species": "Sturnus Vulgaris"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Mourning Dove",
    "species": "Zenaida Macroura"
  }
]
### Adding New Features
Since Render integrates the deploying process with Git, it's straightforward to add new features to your code and deploy them. Let's start by adding a new route in `app.py`:

``` bash
class BirdByID(Resource):
    def get(self, id):
        bird = Bird.query.filter_by(id=id).first().to_dict()
        return make_response(jsonify(bird), 200)

api.add_resource(BirdByID, '/birds/<int:id>')
```

Test your code locally by running `gunicorn app:app` and visiting https://localhost:8000/birds/1

After adding this code, make a commit:

``` bash
$ git add app.py
$ git commit -m 'Added get by ID route'
```

Then, to deploy the changes, push the new code up to GitHub:
``` bash
$ git push
```

After pushing new code, Render will run through the build process again and deploy your changes. This may take a few minutes. Test to make sure the new route works once the deployment is complete.

Note, you don't have to run your migrations again since the database already exists on the server. You would have to run the migrations if you created a new migration file.

## Notes on Render's Free Tier
#### Free Web Services
According to Render's documentation on its Free Web Services:

* Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. Render spins the service back up whenever it next receives a request to process.

* Spinning up a service takes a few seconds, which causes a noticeable delay for incoming requests until the service is back up and running. For example, a browser page load will hang momentarily.

This means that, when you try to navigate to your app in the browser, it might take a while to load.

#### Free PostgreSQL Databases
With Render's free tier, databases expire after 90 days. This means that, before the end of the 90 days, you will need to back up your databases, delete the PostgreSQL instance from Render, create a new PostgreSQL instance, and populate it from the database backups. Render should send an email warning you that your database will be expiring soon.

We will go over the process for backing up and recreating your database — along with some other tips for using databases with Render — in the next lesson.

### Conclusion
Congrats on deploying your first Flask app to the world wide web! Understanding the deployment process and what it takes to run your application on another computer is an important step toward becoming a full-stack developer. Like anything new, this process can be daunting the first time you try it, but with practice and exposure, you'll build confidence over time.

In the next lesson, we'll work on deploying a more complex application with a Flask API backend and a React frontend, and talk through some of the challenges of running these two applications together.
